            <h2>Introduction to the Hebrew Language</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hebrew (עִבְרִית‎) is a Northwest Semitic language (or Northern Central), that belongs to the
                Afroasiatic language family. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites, Judeans
                and their ancestors. It is the only Canaanite language still spoken and the only truly successful
                example of a revived dead language, and one of only two Northwest Semitic languages still spoken,
                the other being Aramaic.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hebrew ceased to be an everyday spoken language sometime between 200 and 400 CE, declining in the
                aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. Aramaic and, to a lesser extent, Greek were already in use as
                international languages, especially among elites, immigrants and generally the Jewish diaspora. Hebrew
                survived into the medieval
                period as the language of Jewish liturgy, rabbinic literature, intra-Jewish commerce, and poetry.
                With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century, it was revived as a spoken and literary language,
                becoming the main language of the Yishuv and subsequently of the State of Israel. Yishuv was the name
                given to the body of Jewish residents prior to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.
                In 2013, Modern Hebrew was spoken by over nine million people worldwide. After Israel, the United
                States has the second largest Hebrew-speaking population, with about 220,000 fluent speakers, mostly
                from Israel.

            </p>

            <p>
                Modern Hebrew is the official language of the State of Israel, while premodern or Biblical Hebrew
                (in Hebrew <i>Ivrit Tanakhit</i>) is used for prayer or study in Jewish communities around the world
                today.
                The Samaritan dialect is also the liturgical tongue of the Samaritans, while modern Hebrew or Arabic
                is their vernacular. As a foreign language, Hebrew is one of the most studied languages in the world,
                mostly by Jews and people with Jewish ancestry,
                students who study Judaism and Israel, by archaeologists (specifically the ones who research the
                Biblical period) and linguists
                specializing in the languages of Middle East and its civilizations,
                by theologians and students in Christian seminaries.
                Nearly all of the Hebrew Bible (in Judaism the <i>Tanakh</i>) is written in Biblical Hebrew, with much
                of
                its present form in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, around
                the time of the Babylonian captivity.

            </p>
                <h2><i>Lashon HaKodesh</i> - Hebrew as a holy language</h2>
            <p> Hebrew stopped being used as a day to day language over two millennia ago, and it was only mainly used
                for religious activities and for liturgy. According to Genesis, God created the world using words, which meant that the Hebrew language is holy. 
                This led to a mystification of the language in Judaism, which meant
                that this is not just an ordinary language, it is the language of God and it should be used properly.  
                Many Jewish movements focused on studying the Hebrew language, for example Kabbalah, the esoteric Jewish 
                mysticism, talks about a secret language code hidden in the Hebrew Bible and the language also has supernatural powers.  
                For more than two thousand years, in Judaism, Hebrew language has been referred to as <i>Lashon HaKodesh</i> (לשון הקודש),
                "the holy language" or "the language of holiness”.
                Out of respect for the holy language, many ultra-orthodox currently only use it for prayer and liturgy, 
                while using Yiddish, Ladino and other languages and dialects for day to day communication.
            </p>

            <h2> Revival of the Hebrew Language</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the past centuries, there have been many attempts to revive the Hebrew language, the most 
                successful one was in the 19th century, when Eliezer Ben-Yehuda joined the Jewish national movement, also 
                known as Zionism, and he immigrated to Palestine, that was part of the Ottoman Empire. He helped establish schools
                where Hebrew was taught and he developped tools that made the literary and liturgical Hebrew into a spoken
                language. This whole process also included borrowing words from several European languages for words that
                did not exist in Hebrew. Ahad Ha'Am also plays a part in this revival process, he founds the Hebrew monthly
                <i> Ha-Shiloaḥ</i>, Hebrew language literary journa at the beginning of twentieth century which is published in Warsaw. 

            </p>

            <p>
                After the fall of the Ottoman empire, the Brittish Mandate of Palestine started in 1920, this recognized Hebrew as one
                of the three official languages, together with English and Arabic. This coincided with a huge wave of immigrants 
                coming to the country, mainly as a result of first world war. Since everyone was speaking a different language, There
                was a great need for people to communicate, this led to the establishment of the Academy of the Hebrew Language. 
                Some Hassidic and ultra-orthodox Jews refused to speak Hebrew, as they considered the language to be holy and
                it was blasphemeous to use it for ordinary communication. 
            </p>

            <h2>Modern-day Hebrew</h2>
            <p>
                According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language#Modern_Hebrew"
                target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> around 53% of the Israeli population speaks Hebrew as a native
                language,
                while most of the rest speak it fluently. Most of the other native languages spoken in Israel are
                Russian, Arabic, French, English, Yiddish and Ladino.
                There are ongoing efforts to keep Hebrew the main language in the state of Israel, the Academy for the Hebrew Language 
                invents around 2000 new Hebrew words each year as a way of promoting the language and
                encouraging people to use Hebrew more and less words from international languages
                such as English.
