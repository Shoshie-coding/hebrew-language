                <h2>Introduction to the Hebrew Language</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Hebrew (עִבְרִית‎) is a Northwest Semitic language (or Northern Central), belonging to the
                    Afroasiatic language family. Historically, it is regarded as the language of the Israelites, Judeans
                    and their ancestors. It is the only Canaanite language still spoken and the only truly successful
                    example of a revived dead language, and one of only two Northwest Semitic languages still spoken,
                    the other being Aramaic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hebrew ceased to be an everyday spoken language sometime between 200 and 400 CE, declining in the
                    aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt. Aramaic and, to a lesser extent, Greek were already in use as
                    international languages, especially among elites and immigrants. Hebrew survived into the medieval
                    period as the language of Jewish liturgy, rabbinic literature, intra-Jewish commerce, and poetry.
                    With the rise of Zionism in the 19th century, it was revived as a spoken and literary language,
                    becoming the main language of the Yishuv (body of Jewish residents prior to the establishment of the
                    State of Israel in 1948 and subsequently of the State of Israel.
                    In 2013, Modern Hebrew was spoken by over nine million people worldwide. After Israel, the United
                    States has the second largest Hebrew-speaking population, with about 220,000 fluent speakers, mostly
                    from Israel.

                <p>
                    Modern Hebrew is the official language of the State of Israel, while premodern or Biblical Hebrew
                    (in Hebrew Ivrit Tanakhit) is used for prayer or study in Jewish communities around the world today.
                    The Samaritan dialect is also the liturgical tongue of the Samaritans, while modern Hebrew or Arabic
                    is their vernacular. As a foreign language, it is studied mostly by Jews and students of Judaism and
                    Israel, by archaeologists and linguists specializing in the Middle East and its civilizations, and
                    by theologians in Christian seminaries.
                    Nearly all of the Hebrew Bible (in Judaism the Tanakh) is written in Biblical Hebrew, with much of
                    its present form in the dialect that scholars believe flourished around the 6th century BCE, around
                    the time of the Babylonian captivity. For this reason, Hebrew has been referred to by Jews as Lashon
                    Hakodesh (לשון הקודש), "the holy language" or "the language of holiness” since ancient times. Many
                    ultra-orthodox will only use it for prayer and liturgy.
