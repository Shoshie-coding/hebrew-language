            <p>
                The Hebrew Alphabet, also considered the holy language of the Hebrew Bile in Judaism, has been
                used throughout the past two-three millennia mainly as script for Biblical Hebrew, modern
                Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, Yiddish, and Ladino, and also some Judean-Arabic and Judean-Persian
                dialects. </p>

            <p>
                Hebrew is an Abjad script, meaning a type of writing system where each symbol or letter stands
                for a consonant, leaving it to readers to infer or supply an appropriate vowel.
                There are various styles or scripts still in use currently, the present and most mainstream
                "Jewish script" or "square script", is a stylized form of the Aramaic alphabet and was
                technically known by Jewish sages as Ashurit (lit. "Assyrian script") since its origins were
                alleged to be from Assyria.

            <h2>The Hebrew Letters</h2>
            <p>
                The Hebrew Alphabet consists of 22 letters, all consonants, it does not have case – there’s no
                distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. Hebrew is written from right to left. Five letters
                have different forms when used at the end of a word.
            </p>
            <h3>Aleph א</h3>
            <p>Aleph is the first letter of the alphabet, in Hebrew alphabet is called <i>Aleph-Bet</i> (אָלֶפְבֵּית)
            </p>
