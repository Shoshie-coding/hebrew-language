            <p>
                The Hebrew Alphabet, also considered the holy language of the Hebrew Bile in Judaism, has been
                used throughout the past two-three millennia mainly as script for Biblical Hebrew, modern
                Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, Yiddish, and Ladino, and also some Judean-Arabic and Judean-Persian
                dialects. </p>

            <p>
                Hebrew is an Abjad script, meaning a type of writing system where each symbol or letter stands
                for a consonant, leaving it to readers to infer or supply an appropriate vowel.
                There are various styles or scripts still in use currently, the present and most mainstream
                "Jewish script" or "square script", is a stylized form of the Aramaic alphabet and was
                technically known by Jewish sages as Ashurit (lit. "Assyrian script") since its origins were
                alleged to be from Assyria.

            <h2>The Hebrew Letters</h2>
            <p>
                The Hebrew Alphabet consists of 22 letters, all consonants, it does not have case – there’s no
                distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. Hebrew is written from right to left. Five letters
                have different forms when used at the end of a word.
            </p>
            <p>Aleph is the first letter of the alphabet, in Hebrew, the alphabet is called <i>Aleph-Bet</i>
                (אָלֶפְבֵּית).
            </p>
            <p>
                In modern Hebrew, the dagesh (lit. emphasis) is an accent placed in the middle of a letter that changes
                the pronunciation of ב‎ bet, כ‎ kaf, and פ‎ pe into [v], [ch] and [f]. We've added a column for
                pronunciation without dagesh so it's easy to see the difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Modern Hebrew, five letters have final forms or <i>sofit</i> (Hebrew: סופית‎). These are only used at
                the end of a word. This final form does not affect the way these letters are pronounced.
            </p>
            <p>The letter Shin is pronounced differently depending on where the dot or accent is placed. If the dot is
                on the upper right side שׁ‎, we pronounce it [sh] as in shadow. If the dot is on the upper left side of
                the letter, we pronounce it [s] as in salad.</p>
            <p>
                Hebrew Language like other Semitic languages has guttural sounds, these are pronounced near the back of
                the throat. There are 5 consonants that are considered guttural letters in Hebrew: Resh, Ayin, Chet,
                Hey, Aleph. There are a lot of differences in the way Israelis and other non-native speakers pronounce
                these letters, for Jewish people coming from European countries, the guttural aspect of the letters is
                mostly lost, except for Chet. Arab Israelis and Jewish people that are originally from Arabic speaking
                countries are able to pronounce the Guttural letters more accurately.
