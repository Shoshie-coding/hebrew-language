            <p>
                The Hebrew Alphabet, also considered the holy language of the Hebrew Bile in Judaism, has been
                used throughout the past two-three millennia mainly as script for Biblical Hebrew, modern
                Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, Yiddish, and Ladino, and also some Judean-Arabic and Judean-Persian
                dialects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hebrew is an Abjad script, meaning a type of writing system where each symbol or letter stands
                for a consonant, leaving it to readers to infer or supply an appropriate vowel.
                There are various styles or scripts still in use currently, the present and most mainstream
                "Jewish script" or "square script", is a stylized form of the Aramaic alphabet and was
                technically known by Jewish sages as Ashurit (lit. "Assyrian script") since its origins were
                alleged to be from Assyria.

            <h2>The Hebrew Letters</h2>

            <p>
                The Hebrew Alphabet consists of 22 letters, all consonants, it does not have case – there’s no
                distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. Hebrew is written from right to left. Five letters
                have different forms when used at the end of a word.
            </p>

            <p>Aleph is the first letter of the alphabet, in Hebrew, the alphabet is called <i>Aleph-Bet</i>
                (אָלֶפְבֵּית).
            </p>

            <h3>Dagesh</h3>
            <p>

                In modern Hebrew, the dagesh (lit. emphasis) is an accent placed in the middle of a letter that changes
                the pronunciation of ב‎ bet, כ‎ kaf, and פ‎ pe into [v], [ch] and [f]. We've added a column for
                pronunciation without dagesh so it's easy to see the difference between the sounds.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Letters</h3>
            <p>

                In Modern Hebrew, five letters have final forms or <i>sofit</i> (Hebrew: סופית‎). These are only used at
                the end of a word. This final form does not affect the way these letters are pronounced.
            </p>

            <p>The letter Shin is pronounced differently depending on where the dot or accent is placed. If the dot is
                on the upper right side שׁ‎, we pronounce it [sh] as in shadow. If the dot is on the upper left side of
                the letter, we pronounce it [s] as in salad.
            </p>

            <h3>Gutturals</h3>
            <p>
                Hebrew Language like other Semitic languages has guttural sounds, these are pronounced near the back of
                the throat. There are 5 consonants that are considered guttural letters in Hebrew:
                <ul>
                    <li>Resh ר‎ - is pronounced as rolled [r] similar to the French word <i>restaurant</i>. </li>
                    <li>Ayin ע - pronounced as if you're clearing your throat.</li>
                    <li>Chet ח is pronounced as [ch] for example Bach. </li>
                    <li>Hey ה - is a very soft [h].</li>
                    <li>Aleph א - also called a glottal stop, is type of consonantal sound that is produced by
                        obstructing airflow in the vocal tract, hence Aleph has no sound, it’s like a pause.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Pronunciation</h3>
            <p>
                There are a lot of differences in pronunciation in modern Hebrew among native and non-native speakers.
                For example, Ashkenazi Jews, Jewish people who have European
                ancestry, don't pronounce most of the guttural letters. Arab Israelis and Jewish people that are
                originally from Arabic speaking countries - mainly Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews - are able to pronounce the
                guttural letters more
                accurately. When learning Hebrew, it's best not to focus too much on pronunciation of guttural letters
                or other types of letters since non-natives usually cannot correctly pronounce these more specific
                sounds. Unless you
                speak a Semitic language or a language that has similar sounds, our advice is to not trouble yourself
                too much with the exact pronunciation and just enjoy the learning process!

            <h3>Listening and speaking practice</h3>
            <p>When learning a new language, the best thing is to listen and try to repeat the letters and words as you
                learn
                them. So a Hebrew lesson wouldn't be complete without pronunciation practice, click on <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jBoMImEpC0&ab_channel=hebrewpodcasts" target="_blank">this
                    YouTube link</a> to hear how the Hebrew letters sound like and give it a go as well!!
            </p>

            <h3>Vowels</h3>
            <p>
                Hebrew language has a system of dots and diacritics that helps readers determine where vowels
                are and how to pronounce words - this is called <i>niqqud</i>. This was developped historically by the
                Masoretes
                (Jewish scribes and scholars) between the 5th and the 10th centuries. This was initially meant
                to
                standardize
                pronunciation, paragraph, verse division and cantillation or chanting of the Hebrew Bible (the
                Tanakh).
                In writing, these are only used to teach children or beginners Hebrew, in religious texts such
                as prayer books or the Hebrew Bible and in borrowed words.

            <h3><i>Mater Lectionis</i> (from Latin "mothers of reading")</h3>
            <p>
                There are 4 weak consonants that act as vowels in Hebrew, these are Aleph, Hey, Vav and Yud.
                They are
                used in combination with diacritics or voewls - usually Aleph and Ayin are mute and only
                indicate that the letter should be pronounced as a vowel.

            <h3>Gematria</h3>
            <p>
                Hebrew letters have numerical values. Similar to Roman numerals, letters are added together to equal a
                given number, and the letters retain their essential worth no matter where they are placed in a
                sequence, so tav, kaf, and aleph, for example, equal 421. This system is called Gematria in Judaism.
                In modern Israel, western numerals are used as a rule, whereas Hebrew letters are used for days of the
                week or dates in the Hebrew calendar.
