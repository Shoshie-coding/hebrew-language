# Hebrew Language

The goal of this website is to provide people information about the Hebrew language, alphabet, and most common Hebrew words. It is mainly aimed at people who are generally interested in learning about the Hebrew language and culture. Using beautiful pictures from Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, it also hopes to stir people's curiosity about Jewish culture and civilisation.

## Design

### Color Theme and imagery
[Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) was used to extract the main three colors of the website: blue, cream and dark brown. The colors were extracted from imagages on my website. These are old Hebrew manuscripts and Hebrew illuminated manuscripts that show the beauty of the Hebrew alphabet and Jewish art. 

### Typography
For the main text, 'Montserrat' font is used with a fall-back on sans-serif. For headings, navigation bar and footer, 'Arima Madurai' font is used with a fallback on cursive.
