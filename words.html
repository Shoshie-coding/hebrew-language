    <h1>Common Hebrew Phrases</h1>
    <h2> Shalom (שָׁלוֹם)</h2>
    <p>
        Shalom is the most well known Hebrew word. It means Hello, goodbye, and peace.
        It is also found in the saying <i>Shalom Aleichem</i> (Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם‎, 'Peace be upon you') which is
        a traditional song sung by Jews every Friday night upon returning home from synagogue prayer on the eve of the
        Shabbat.

    </p>

    <h2><i>Ken</i> and <i>Lo</i></h2>
    <p>
        <i>Ken</i> means Yes and <i>Lo</i> means No - we can see this in the famous brand Kenvelo – which literally
        means Yes and No where <i>ve</i> means and.
    </p>
    <h2><i>Slicha</i></h2>
    <p><i>Slicha</i> means sorry or excuse me.</p>

    <h2><i>Toda</i></h2>
    <p>
        <i>Toda</i> means thank you it’s used often in the phrase <i>Toda raba</i>meaning thank you very much.
    </p>
    <h2><i>BeVakasha</i></h2>
    <p>
        Saying <i>BeVakasha</i> is a common and polite way to respond to someone thanking you. When someone says
        <i>Toda</i> or <i>Toda raba</i>, you can simply reply with BeVakasha. It also means please.
