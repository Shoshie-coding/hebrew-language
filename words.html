            <h2> <i>Shalom</i> (שָׁלוֹם)</h2>
            <p>
                Shalom is perhaps the most well known Hebrew word. It means hello, goodbye, and peace.
                It is also found in the saying <i>Shalom Aleichem</i> (Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם‎, 'Peace be upon
                you') which
                is also
                a traditional song sung by Jews every Friday night upon returning home from synagogue prayer on the
                eve of
                the
                Shabbat.
            </p>

            <h2><i>Ken</i> and <i>Lo</i></h2>
            <p>
                <i>Ken</i> means Yes and <i>Lo</i> means No - we can see this in the famous brand Kenvelo – which
                literally
                means Yes and No where <i>ve</i> means "and".
            </p>

            <h2><i>Slicha</i></h2>
            <p><i>Slicha</i> means sorry or excuse me.</p>

            <h2><i>Toda</i></h2>
            <p>
                <i>Toda</i> means thank you it’s used often in the phrase <i>Toda raba</i>meaning thank you very
                much.
            </p>
            <h2><i>BeVakasha</i></h2>
            <p>
                Saying <i>BeVakasha</i> is a common and polite way to respond to someone thanking you. When someone
                says
                <i>Toda</i> or <i>Toda raba</i>, you can simply reply with BeVakasha. It also means please.
            </p>
