        <h2>Hebrew Root Words</h2>
        <p>
            In Semitic languages, and Hebrew is no exception, most words derive from a
            three-consonant root word that contains the intrinsic meaning of the word. This root word is called
            <i>shoresh</i> and by adding letters at the beginning and end of the root, you get various parts of
            speech like nouns, verbs and adjectives. You will see further on that it is normal for Hebrew words have
            more than one meaning. This is also because modern Hebrew gave old words new meanings to make
            up for the lack of modern words.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope that you enjoy the below selection of Hebrew words and that you learn something new about this beautiful
            language!
        </p>

        <!-- Hebrew Common Phrases -->
        <h2><i>Shalom</i> (שלום)</h2>
        <p>
            Shalom is perhaps the most well-known Hebrew word. It means hello, goodbye, and peace.
            It is also found in the saying <i>Shalom Aleichem</i> (Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם‎, 'Peace be upon
            you') which is also a traditional song sung by Jews every Friday night upon returning home
            from synagogue prayer on the eve of the Shabbat.
        </p>
        <h2><i>Ken</i> (כן) and <i>Lo</i> (לֹא)</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Ken</i> means Yes and <i>Lo</i> means No - we can see this in the famous brand Kenvelo – which
            literally
            means Yes and No (<i>ve</i> means 'and').
        </p>
        <h2 class="clear"><i>Slicha</i> (סליחה)</h2>
        <p> <i>Slicha</i> means sorry or excuse me.</p>
        <h2> <i>Toda</i> (תודה)</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Toda</i> means thank you it’s used often in the phrase <i>Toda raba</i> meaning thank you very
            much.
        </p>
        <h2> <i>BeVakasha</i> (בבקשה)</h2>
        <p>
            In Hebrew <i>BeVakasha</i> is used as a way of saying 'with pleasure' or 'you're welcome' and 'please'.
            When someone says
            <i>Toda</i> 'Thank you', you can reply with <i>BeVakasha</i>. Similarly, you can ask something from
            someone
            using <i>BeVakasha</i> in the sentence.

            <h2> <i>Mayim</i> (מים)</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Mayim</i> means 'water' – the interesting fact about Mayim is that’s it’s a dual noun. Dual nouns
                in Hebrew usually have no singular form.
            </p>
            <h2><i>Shamayim</i> (שמיים)</h2>
            <p>
                A similar dual noun is <i>Shamayim</i> which means 'heavens' or 'skies'.
            </p>
            <h2><i>Mazel Tov</i> (מזל טוב)</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Mazel Tov</i> literally means 'good luck' and 'congratulations'. It's something people say to
                someone getting married.
            </p>
            <h2><i>Ma Shlomcha?</i> (מה שלומך)</h2>
            <p>
                This is a way of asking someone 'How are you?', it literally means 'what (is) your peace?'. You
                probably
                notice the word <i>Shalom</i> in <i>Shlomcha</i> because there are from the same Hebrew root
                <i>Shalem</i> (שלם) that means 'whole' and 'complete'. Similarly, <i>Ma Nishma</i> (מה נשמע)
                means 'What's up?'.
            </p>
            <h2><i>Baruch HaShem</i> (ברוך השם)</h2>
            <p>
                It literally means 'Blessed be the name' where name refers to God, in Judaism you're not supposed
                to
                pronounce God's name as his name is holy as God is holy. It's very versatile and can mean different
                things
                depending on the context, for example it's used to say, 'I can't complain' or 'It is what it is' to
                say you
                accept a certain situation.
            </p>

            <h2><i>Beseder</i> (בסדר)</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Beseder</i> is used in many phrases to express that something or someone is OK. For example,
                <i>HaKol Beseder</i>
                (הכול בסדר) means 'everything is OK', whereas <i>Yihye BeSeder</i> (יהיה בסדר) means
                'It will be OK' or 'no worries'.
            </p>
